Traditional audio denoising systems often require access to clean data to properly train to remove noise. Since clean audio is often unavailable, we build on a partitioned denoising autoencoder for denoising audio signals when clean examples are unavailable for training. In addition, we compare existing semi-supervised denoising systems as well as canonical supervised denoising autoencoders. We show that for moderate levels of noise, our autoencoder can outperform existing schemes.
