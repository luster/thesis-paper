Traditional audio denoising systems are often linear time-invariant (LTI) and often require access to clean data to properly train to remove noise. Since clean audio is often unavailable, we build on a partitioned denoising autoencoder for denoising audio signals when clean examples are unavailable for training. In addition, the nonlinearity of a neural network architecture provides additional gains over standard linear models. We compare existing semi-supervised denoising systems as well as canonical supervised denoising autoencoders. We show that for moderate levels of noise, our autoencoder can outperform existing schemes.
