simulation

input data - an audio file or two
    input snr
    baseline mse
    generate something?
    sample rate
some configuration
    window / hop
    frame length
    preproc?
    frequency transform or not?
    more preproc?
    network?
        type
        layer sizes
        loss func
        training updates
    running sim
        what to collect
        how many iterations
    result
        what figures/metrics to save
        model to save

standard
========
pass a time signal - default is speech? sine?
pass a noise signal - default is awgn? bar noise?
specify snr for simulation - default is 10dB? something else?
sample rate - default is 44.1kHz? maybe lower for faster training
window - default it hanning + 50% overlap (or 75%)
frame length - default should be power of 2 around 10-15 msec - 4096?
