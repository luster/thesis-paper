This thesis would not be possible without the guidance and support from my advisor, Dr. Sam Keene. He has mentored me since I was an undergraduate, and I am grateful for him helping this project come to life. I also want to thank Christopher Curro, my informal second advisor who helped me to think outside the box and for whom the overall system architecture is named after.

I would like to thank Kate Thorsen for pushing me past my potential and encouraging me to stay positive despite the frustrations of research. Lastly, I would like to thank my friends and family for their support. This thesis would not have been possible without all their support.
