\subsection{Conclusions}
While more work is needed, deep partitioned neural network architectures using time and frequency data seem promising in long-term solutions for denoising speech and music signals.

\subsection{Future Work}
\subsubsection{Models}
Make network deeper. Consider gradual partitioning instead of hard.

\subsubsection{Data}
Get more data. Consider different noise levels and types of signals.
